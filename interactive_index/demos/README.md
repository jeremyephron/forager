## Dev Notes

### Dependency management with `pipenv`
- Install requirements with `pipenv install`
- Install developer requirements (like `jupyter`) with `pipenv install --dev`
- Add packages (like "mihir-run") and their dependencies to `setup.py` in the root directory
- To add a dependency that's not for a package, install with `pipenv install <dependency>`
- To add a dependency for development, install with `pipenv install --dev <dependency>`
